title: File upload size 
---

Along side the [uSync.Publisher](../introduction/publisher) settings and config, there are options you can set inside Umbraco to make publisher work better. 

## Upload File Size 
When you publish a page or set of pages with the `includeMedia` option set, publisher will try to calculate what media files are required on the target server. The required media items are then zipped up and sent over as required. 

For a new page or set of pages this could be a large amount of media and the default upload config of 5mb could be too small, resulting in a `404.13` error from the server during the sync.

To help with this, during install uSync.Publisher will add the following to the sites web.config file :

```xml title="web.config"
<location path="umbraco/uSyncReceive">
<!-- Up the file upload limit to 500mb, this is for moving media around -->
  <system.web>
    <httpRuntime maxRequestLength="512000"/>
  </system.web>
  <system.webServer>
    <security>
    <!-- Restrict API access by IP - 
        you can here restrict so only the servers
        can talk to each other -->
    <!--
    <ipSecurity allowUnlisted="false">
        <add allowed="true" ipAddress="192.168.0.1" subnetMask="255.255.255.0" />
        <add allowed="true" ipAddress="127.0.0.1" subnetMask="255.255.255.0" />
    </ipSecurity>
    -->
    <requestFiltering>
        <requestLimits maxAllowedContentLength="524288000" />
    </requestFiltering>
    </security>
  </system.webServer>
</location>
```

This will up the upload limit for the `Umbraco/uSyncReceive' root to 500mb allowing for a large number of media files to be synced as part of a single publish. 

It also puts a placeholder in, should you wish to restrict the publisher root by IP address for security reasons.
