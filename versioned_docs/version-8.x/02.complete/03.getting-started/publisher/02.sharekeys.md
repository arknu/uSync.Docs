# 2. Share API Keys

To ensure messages are authentic, uSync.Publisher signs all communication between Umbraco instances using a shared API ID and Key. 

Before you can successfully send anything between sites you will need to make sure all sites have a shared API ID and Key setup in their configuration files.

When you start up uSync.Publisher for the first time it will create a random appID and AppKey in the `uSync.Publish.config` file. You should copy these keys to all other instances that you want to be able to communicate with. 

### Example Key/ID
```c#
  <!-- Restart the Application after changing these values! -->
  <appId>3c5dbae0-a88e-47be-86e8-b5532a203c6a</appId>
  <appKey>feGGDIdIamBqGPoTaWBfTWjSJfqUIfm1ZN5ZA3UsP9Y=</appKey>
```

### Per Server Keys, 
By default, uSync.Publisher will use the `appId` and `appKey` values in the root of the configuration settings, but for extra security you can set these values for each individual server.

Setting the values in the `<server>` section of the config will make uSync.Publisher use those values for outgoing communication.

> All incoming communication will use the values in the root settings node, so the appID and appKey in a server's section must match the values that the server has in its root section.
