### 3. Review Report & Apply 

Once the changes have been sent, the server will return a change report which will detail any changes that have been made.

You can then review these changes. If you are happy you can choose to apply the changes on the server. 

### 4. Complete
Once you have done this, you will again see the progress screen while the changes are applied, and you will get a final screen showing you the changes you have made.
