# uSync.ContentEdition

Content Edition adds new serializers and [handlers](../reference/handlers) to the standard uSync package. This enables you to sync content and media elements between Umbraco installations.

These handlers manage the following elements:

- Content
- Media
- Dictionary Items
- Domains (Culture and Hostnames)
- Content Templates (a.k.a blueprints)
