title: uSync Events
---

You can hook into the uSync process at a number of points. These events will be fired, and you can process the elements.

### Batch Events
These events fire at the beginning and end of any process, you can use these events to prep before or cleanup after a uSync event.

```cs
uSyncService.ImportStarting
uSyncService.ImportComplete
uSyncService.ExportStarting
uSyncService.ExportComplete
uSyncService.ReportStarting
uSyncService.ReportComplete
```


### Item events
These events fire before/after an individual item is process. On the 'ing' events (e.g reportingItem) you can cancel the process by setting Cancel to true on the passed object.

```cs
uSyncService.ReportingItem
uSyncService.ReportedItem

uSyncService.ImportingItem
uSyncService.ImportedItem

uSyncService.ExportingItem
uSyncService.ExportedItem
```
