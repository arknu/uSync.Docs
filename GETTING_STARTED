2. A Fork of the github repo. (click on fork top right)

## Software you need make this work.

 2. Visual studio code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
 3. Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Internal demo site: 
(available only in Jumoo towers)
http://usync.cube.jumoo.co.uk/umbraco

## Running locally.

```console
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Committing back to the repo. 
When you have made any changes, you will be able to submit a Pull Request (PR) - that will propose your changes back to the main copy (repository) of the site. 

Once a PR has been merged into the main repository, the site will be build and published online.
