title: Set Up the Dictionary Handler
---


## Change the DictionaryHandler's Group
By default the DictionaryHandler is treated as a content handler, so Dictionary items are synced when you sync content. 

It might be that you want your Dictionary items to be synced as settings and this can be done by changing the group the DictionaryHandler is assigned to. 

```json title=appsettings.json 
{
    "uSync" : {
        "Sets": {
            "Default" :{
                "Handlers" : {
                    "DictionaryHandler" : {
                        "Group": "Settings" 
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Make the Dictionary Handler "Create" only
You may also want to configure the dictionary handler so it only syncs new entries and leaves existing items that your users might have entered alone, you can configure the handler to be 'CreateOnly' so it will only sync new items:


```json title=appsettings.json 
{
    "uSync" : {
        "Sets": {
            "Default" :{
                "Handlers" : {
                    "DictionaryHandler" : {
                        "Settings": {
                            "CreateOnly": true 
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
