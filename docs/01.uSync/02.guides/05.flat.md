title: Flat File Structure
---

By default, uSync will store all of the items of the same 'type' (e.g DataTypes) in a flat folder structure. 

This means regardless of folders you may have on disk, all items of the same type will be in one folder. 
This is done to reduce the risk of encountering long file names where the combination of all the item names would cause the operating system to reject the file path for being to long. 

You can turn this feature off in the settings. uSync will then store each item under a folder representing the parent item or folder in Umbraco. This will make the uSync directory directly match what you see in Umbraco.


## UseFlatStructure
The default value for this settings is **true.**

```json title='appsettings.json'
"uSync": {
    "Sets" : {
        "Default" : {
            "UseFlatStructure": false
        }
    }
}
```
