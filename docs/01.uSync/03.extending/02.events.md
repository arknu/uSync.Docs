You can hook into the uSync process at a number of points. These events will be fired, and you can process the elements.

:::tip
For Umbraco 9 - events are fired a Notifications, you will need to register a NotificationHandler to receive the event notification
:::

### Batch Notifications
These events fire at the beginning and end of any process, you can use these events to prep before or cleanup after a uSync event.

```cs
// using uSync.BackOffice

uSyncImportStartingNotification
uSyncImportCompleteNotification
uSyncExportStartingNotification
uSyncExportCompletedNotification
uSyncReportStartingNotification
uSyncReportCompletedNotification
```


### Item Notifications
These events fire before/after an individual item is process. On the 'ing' events (e.g reportingItem) you can cancel the process by setting Cancel to true on the passed object.

```cs
// using uSync.BackOffice 

uSyncReportingItemNotification
uSyncReportedItemNotification

uSyncImportingItemNotification
uSyncImportedItemNotification

uSyncExportingItemNotification
uSyncExportedItemNotification
```
