[uSync.Publisher](../introduction/publisher) is sending your content and media between Umbraco instances, and as such security and integrity of the messages been sent is paramount. 

uSync.Publisher signs all communications with a [HMAC authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC) key using the AppId and AppKey settings from the `uSync.Publish.Config` file. Alongside this you should include some basic security configuration to secure your sites. 

## Use Https
While uSync.Publisher doesn't force HTTPS communication between Umbraco instances it is strongly recommended that you do use HTTPs protocols when setting up server addresses. You can [configure Umbraco to force Https for all back office communication](https://our.umbraco.com/Documentation/Reference/Security/use-https#set-usessl-configuration-option) in the `appsettings.json` file.

## Use unique AppId/AppKey Values
When uSync.Publisher first runs it will generate a AppId and AppKey value for the config, it is recommended you then use this value to communicate between servers (making sure all servers have the same config). **Do not use blank or short AppId/AppKey values.**

:::tip
You can if you choose have different AppId/AppKey pairs for each configured server, while this is a slightly more complex configuration it does allow you to have greater control of what can send where.
